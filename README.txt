You are the codemaker. As the codemaker, choose a pattern of four colors. 
Six colors to choose from are: BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE, PURPLE, RED and YELLOW. 
Duplicates are allowed, so you may choose a pattern of four of the same color.

Mastermind codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten  turns. 

Start Mastermind by clicking START GAME button at the bottom of the board. 

Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. 

In the answer pad, indicate which colored pegs are correct:
* WHITE (left mouse click) key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position
* BLACK (right mouse click) key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.

Click SUBMIT ANSWER

Mastermind will try to guess your code within 10 turns.
